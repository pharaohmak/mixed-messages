# Group Project: Mixed Messages

You can learn a lot on your own, but you can learn even more when you collaborate with others!

## Group Projects in The Full-Stack Engineer Path

As part of this Career Path, you will have the opportunity to connect with other learners to practice and apply your new skills. This is optional! Throughout the career path, we will sometimes prompt you to work with peers, but you should feel free to work with others as often as you like to gain practice!

### How to Conduct a Group Project

#### Step One – Understand the Project

Select what you would like to work on together. We suggest Mixed Messages <https://www.codecademy.com/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/tracks/fscp-javascript-syntax-portfolio-project/modules/fscp-mixed-messages/kanban_projects/mixed-messages>, which will help you to collaborate on creating a terminal application using JavaScript. Alternatively, come up with your own project that uses these technologies. If you’re familiar with HTML/CSS, you’re also welcome to turn this application into an interactive website.

Assess the prompt or project requirements:

* What technical skill sets do you need to complete the assignment? Will you need design, front- and back-end, and data analysis?
* How advanced a skillset in each is required and how much work is there to go around?

From here you’ll know which roles your project needs and how many people are necessary. Your project may only need one other person or could have four or more collaborators, depending on the size and complexity of the project.

#### Step Two – Find Your Teammates

Find collaborators! Visit your group <http://codecademy.com/cohorts/full-stack-engineer-career-path>. You can also find collaborators in the full-stack-engineer channel in Codecademy’s Discord server <https://discord.gg/g5vzQCstyB>. If still looking for others to work with, check out the Codecademy Facebook group <https://www.facebook.com/groups/codecademy.community/>, in a Codecademy Chapter <http://community.codecademy.com/>, or at local meetups.

When you arrive, be sure to introduce yourself with the following information:

* What % of the path you have completed
* What timezone or country you’re in
* A link to your Codecademy Profile
* One fun fact about yourself

#### Step Three – Build Your Team

Now that you’ve found people to work with, the next step is to figure out how each of you would like to contribute to this project.

These are some different roles that you and your teammates could take. Also, one person can have more than one role and more than one person could have the same role.

* team lead who also codes. To learn a lot more about being a team lead, please see this post <https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/what-does-a-project-manager-do/568547>.
* UX/UI designer who also codes
* front-end developer
* back-end developer

#### Step Four – Learn How Teams Work

You all have some foundational work to do, all of which differs depending on your team roles. To learn a lot more about the responsibilities of each team role, see this post <https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/guide-how-developer-teams-work/394900>.

#### Step Five – Get to Work

Get to it! Have a kick-off meeting, ideally over a video chat platform, so you can all meet one another and discuss the project.

Remember that if and when you get stuck, you can lean on each other in order to get through problems. In the real world, developers troubleshoot their own work first with tried and true methods, but they often ask teammates for help too. If your teammates can’t help either, reach out to your group or in the Discord server <https://discord.com/invite/codecademy>.

Sometimes, life happens. Even in the “real world” workplace, people get sick or leave projects, too. If someone leaves your group and you need a replacement, post in the Discord server and the community will try to help you out.

#### Step Six – Share

If you completed the Mixed Messages <https://www.codecademy.com/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/tracks/fscp-javascript-syntax-portfolio-project/modules/fscp-mixed-messages/kanban_projects/mixed-messages> Project, share it with fellow learners on its forum page <https://discuss.codecademy.com/c/project/portfolio-project-mixed-messages/1900>. If you choose to do another project, post your project in the Projects category <https://discuss.codecademy.com/c/project/1833> and share it with the other learners in your group or on Discord! Getting feedback is a vital part of the development process and in growing your skills. Remember to give back to other people wanting feedback or guidance, not just because it’s a good thing to do, but you’ll also benefit by explaining to others what you’ve learned.

If you’re feeling generous, don’t just share your work but share your insights and guidance for the next team tackling something similar. Paying it forward and giving back is how the developer world works – entire systems have been built this way <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Linux>.
